# JWT Standart Token Php

Standard progect token with php.

## Start 

Practical example for this they will have to play with the URL to be able to make the example work.

* We execute the following route: index.php?p=autentica
* This will generate a TOKEN for us and we copy said TOKEN to do the necessary tests.
* We execute the following route: index.php?p=verifica&t={token}

We replace {token} by the value that we copied in step 1, if everything is fine we will see the information of our user that we save in the token.

Very Goog!
